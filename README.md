## üìà Market Dynamics :

**20th May 2025 ‚Äì** Rapid internet penetration has increased the convenience and accessibility of online buying and delivery, which is accelerating revenue growth of Delivery-as-a-Service (DaaS) market. According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), 68% of the world's population, or 5.5 billion people, will use the Internet by 2024. The year-on-year growth rate has also increased, from 2.7% last year to 3.4% this year.

The delivery-as-a-service (DaaS) market for quick prescription medicine delivery is predicted to expand rapidly. According to research, over half of US counties have areas that are more than 10 miles from the nearest pharmacy, limiting quick access to pharmacies. Traditional mail-order prescriptions might take up to ten days to arrive; DaaS providers can capitalize on this potential by providing speedy medicine delivery within hours. 

Consumers are significantly prioritizing quick commerce owing to rising disposable income in high income countries are further attributed to the expansion of the market.  According to the OECD, the United States leads in average gross disposable income at USD 54,854, followed by Luxembourg at USD 49,860 and Switzerland at USD 43,035.

Integration of sustainable delivery processes and environmentally friendly transportation choices is developing as an important industry trend in the Delivery-as-a-Service (DaaS) market. Autonomous delivery robots (ADRs) are quickly being integrated into the fast delivery of food and other retail services, owing to lack of delivery partners.  

However, rising prices for petrol are projected to slow market revenue growth. Many Delivery-as-a-Service (DaaS) providers operate with engine-powered fleets. Fuel price fluctuations may raise the total cost of operating for DaaS services. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), benchmark crude oil prices rose in early January as a result of rising US sanctions on Iran and Russia, along with extreme cold weather over most of the Northern Hemisphere.
